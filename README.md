# Single Cell Migration Analysis App

A PyQt-based desktop application for analyzing cell trajectories using various quantitative metrics such as:

* **Mean Squared Displacement (MSD)**
* **Speed**
* **Directionality Ratio**
* **Autocorrelation**

This tool helps researchers and analysts efficiently process and visualize tracked cell movement data.

Based on the study:  
**Quantitative and unbiased analysis of directional persistence in cell migration**

## Features

* Load data from Excel files.
* Support for multiple sheets (condition per sheet).
* Trajectory plotting.
* Exportable plots (PNG, PDF).
* Migration Analyses include:

  * **Speed** with average and SEM.
  * **MSD** by cell and condition.
  * **Directionality Ratio**.
  * **Autocorrelation**.
* Statistical Tests:
    * **Mannâ€“Whitney U test** (non-parametric version of the t-test)
    * **ANOVA**

# Installation Instructions

---

## 1. Running from Source (Manual Setup with Python)

If you want to run the app directly from source code, follow these steps:

### Requirements

* Python 3.10+ installed ([download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installing dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OvsPolina/cell_migration_analysis.git
cd cell_migration_analysis
python -m venv venv                # create a virtual environment (recommended)
source venv/bin/activate           # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate.bat          # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt    # install dependencies
```

### Running the application

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 2. Running the Standalone Executable (.exe) â€” Windows

A ready-to-use `cell_migration_analysis.exe` file that does **not require Python or any dependencies installed** on your system.

### How to use

1. Download `cell_migration_analysis.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/OvsPolina/cell_migration_analysis) section
2. Run it by double-clicking the file
3. The app will open as a normal desktop program

> **Note:** The executable file size may be around 50-100 MB due to the embedded Python interpreter and libraries.

---

## 3. Installer Setup (Coming Soon)

In upcoming releases, an **installer for Windows** will be provided which will allow you to:

* Install the program into `Program Files`
* Create shortcuts on Desktop and Start Menu
* Easily uninstall via Control Panel ("Programs and Features")

> Stay tuned for updates in the [Releases](https://github.com/OvsPolina/cell_migration_analysis) section.

# Usage Instructions

Below you will find descriptions of the main interface elements along with screenshots for macOS and Windows, highlighting key buttons and their functions.

---

## Main Window Overview

The main window contains several important buttons and panels that help you load data, run analyses, and visualize results.

### Interface on macOS

![Mac Interface](path/to/mac_screenshot.png)  
*Figure 1: Main interface on macOS.*

- **Open File** (top-left) â€” Click this button to open a file dialog and load sample data files into the application.  
- **Analysis Type Dropdown** (next to Load Data) â€” Select the type of analysis you want to perform, such as Autocorrelation or MSD.  
- **Run Analysis** (right of dropdown) â€” Executes the selected analysis on the loaded data.  
- **Save Results** (bottom-right) â€” Saves the processed data and generated plots to your chosen location.  
- **Data Table** (center) â€” Displays the loaded dataset and updated results after analysis.  

---

### Interface on Windows

![Windows Interface](path/to/windows_screenshot.png)  
*Figure 2: Main interface on Windows.*

- **Load Data** button is located at the top toolbar. Clicking it allows you to import data files.  
- **Analysis Selector** dropdown is to the right of Load Data and lets you choose the analysis method.  
- **Run Analysis** button initiates the selected analysis process.  
- **Save Results** button is near the bottom of the window to export data and figures.  
- The **Data Table** updates dynamically with loaded data and analysis output.  

---

## How to Use the Application

1. **Load Your Data**  
   Click the **Load Data** button and select one or more data files. The data will be displayed in the table view.

2. **Choose Analysis Type**  
   Use the **Analysis Type** dropdown to select your desired analysis method.

3. **Configure Parameters**  
   Input parameters such as *time interval* and *number of plot points* in the settings panel (usually located on the right side or in a separate tab).

4. **Run the Analysis**  
   Click **Run Analysis** to process the data. Results will appear in the table and plots will open in a separate dialog.

5. **View and Save Results**  
   Inspect the plot dialogs for graphical summaries. Use the **Save Results** button to export both data and plots.
